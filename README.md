# 📊 Environmental and Socioeconomic Dashboard Analysis

This repository contains the analysis and dashboards created as part of a data exploration project covering environmental and socioeconomic trends using publicly available datasets from **Kaggle**. The work includes exploratory analysis, correlation studies, and visual dashboard creation using tools such as Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Power BI, and Tableau.

## 📁 Datasets Used

1. **U.S. Pollution Data (2000–2010)**  
   Source: Kaggle  
   Focus: NO2 AQI, SO2 AQI, O3 AQI, temperature trends across California

2. **Life Expectancy Dataset (2000–2014)**  
   Source: Kaggle  
   Focus: Life expectancy, GDP, CO2 emissions, health expenditure, internet adoption, drinking water access, and more for countries in South Asia and the Middle East

## 🧪 Project Goals

1. Analyze the relationship between **pollution** and **temperature** in California.
2. Study the impact of **temperature** on **pollution indicators** such as NO2, SO2, and O3.
3. Explore **socioeconomic and environmental trends** in:
   - **South Asia** (with a focus on India and Pakistan)
   - **Middle East** (including GDP, CO2 emissions, military spending, etc.)

## 📌 Analysis Questions Answered

### 📍 Dataset 1: Pollution and Temperature in California

- What is the impact of pollution factors (NO2 AQI, SO2 AQI, O3 AQI) on temperature over time?
- How does temperature influence pollution levels?

#### 🔍 Key Insights:

- **NO2 AQI vs Temperature**: Negative correlation  
- **SO2 AQI vs Temperature**: Negative correlation  
- **O3 AQI vs Temperature**: Positive correlation
